# User-Gen
User generation in the form of username, password and email formated in JSON.

The objective of this script is to meke the usernames as legitimate as possible.
This is achivable by using a complex probability tree in the creation of the string.

In terms of the password, a consistent algorithm is used and given only the username 
as input. It is recommended to change the password generation function if this script 
is intended to be used for personal reasons.
